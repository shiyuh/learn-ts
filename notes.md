* TS = JS + Type system
* TS type system
    * Help us catch errors during dev
    * Uses 'type annotation' to analyze the code
    * Only active during dev (compiled to JS)
    * Doesn't provide any performance optimization
 * Think of TypeScript as a being like a friend sitting behind you while you are coding
